# Reminder
JavaFX application. The application is made for a factory that makes tires for cars.

Project’s requirements: Any Java IDE and JDK 8.

Description: The application works like a reminder and keeps track of all mold changes for raw rubber vulcanization.
When the application is started, the application loads mold changes, which were used in the past.
After loading, those mold changes can be removed, one by one or all at once. For each new mold change,
it is necessary to insert a few things like a press number, selecting the side of the press where the mold will change,
choosing the mold’s change type, choosing  the mold type and whether the hotplates on the press are cold.
After that, the user is required to insert the time when the mold change will start and after some time to insert when the change is finished.
According to the mold type, the application calculates the time for necessary mold heating and determines when the press should continue production.
Further, it is also possible to add additional information for the press and to manipulate that information like editing and removing.
The application has two modes of showing information. The  First mode shows all mold changes, the second shows only unfinished changes.
